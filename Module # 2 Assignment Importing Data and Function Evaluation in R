Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found

#This error is caused by incorrect names being inserted into the R code.
#In line 3, the return(sum(assignment), value is incorrect, as it is telling the function to return the value of a vector named assignment. The same can be said about the length with someData
#The vector we want is assignment2, so to fix this problem, we correct the code below.
